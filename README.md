This is my attempt to remake the infamous Gossip Girl website from the show [Gossip Girl (2007)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossip_Girl).

## My Process

- looked on pinterest for gossip girl inspo. I figured that it would be faster to look up screenshots than watch the show in all its entirety.
- the design varies slightly from episode to episode, but the two main versions are the hot pink layout and the night time city one. I chose the night time city version because it shows up more often on the show.

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Custom CSS properties
- desktop-first workflow (mainly because the gossip girl website was around at a time when mobile-first wasn't a thing yet)
